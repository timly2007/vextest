Mobile Goal Recognition off Camera Data

Utilizes a rudimentary 3-kernel CNN to identify a VEX Robotics Mobile Goal's location. Works best in static lighting conditions and is trained off VEX Vision sensor input.

Couldn't figure out a way to implement into competitions as I don't know if it's possible to even acquire pixel-by-pixel data.
